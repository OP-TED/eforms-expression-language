# EFX Toolkit 1.0.1 Release Notes

The EFX Toolkit for Java developers is a library that enables the transpilation of [EFX](https://docs.ted.europa.eu/eforms/latest/efx) expressions and templates to different target languages. It also provides an implementation that turns an EFX expression into XPath.

This patch adds a temporary workaround for basic number formatting. The issue will be addressed properly after the next major release of the SDK.

You can download the latest EFX Toolkit from Maven Central.
