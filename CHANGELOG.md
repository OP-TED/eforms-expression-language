# EFX Toolkit 1.0.0 Release Notes

The EFX Toolkit for Java developers is a library that enables the transpilation of [EFX](https://docs.ted.europa.eu/eforms/latest/efx) expressions and templates to different target languages. It also provides an implementation that turns an EFX expression into XPath.

In this release we added an implementation of EFX grammar for SDK 1.x.x.

We also made improvements in the way multiple versions of the SDK can be supported.

Documentation for the EFX Toolkit is available at: https://docs.ted.europa.eu/eforms/latest/efx-toolkit

This version of the EFX Toolkit has a compile-time dependency on the following versions of eForms SDK versions and uses the EFX grammar that each version provides:
- eForms SDK 0.6.x
- eForms SDK 0.7.x
- eForms SDK 1.x.x
