# EFX Toolkit 1.0.1 Release Notes

The EFX Toolkit for Java developers is a library that enables the transpilation of [EFX](https://docs.ted.europa.eu/eforms/latest/efx) expressions and templates to different target languages. It also provides an implementation that turns an EFX expression into XPath.

This patch adds a temporary workaround for basic number formatting. The issue will be addressed properly after the next major release of the SDK.

Documentation for the EFX Toolkit is available at: https://docs.ted.europa.eu/eforms/latest/efx-toolkit

This version of the EFX Toolkit has a compile-time dependency on the following versions of eForms SDK versions and uses the EFX grammar that each version provides:
- eForms SDK 0.6.x
- eForms SDK 0.7.x
- eForms SDK 1.x.x
